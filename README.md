# Computational Conformal Geometry Homework

Note: For this assignment, you must replace shaderPath of your own in viewer.cpp. Otherwise, the program will crash!

/* Input your own shader path */
std::string shaderPath("C:/proj/Assignment2/harmonic_map/shaders/");


This C++ project framework is used to help students to implement geometric algorithms.

## System

The code has been tested on Windows 11, if there is any problem, please let me know.
