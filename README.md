# Harmonic Map

Note: You must replace shaderPath of your own in viewer.cpp. Otherwise, the program will crash!

/* Input your own shader path */
std::string shaderPath("C:/proj/Assignment2/harmonic_map/shaders/");


## System

The code has been tested on Windows 11, if there is any problem, please let me know.
